# Project Description

To avoid reinventing the wheel, many identity projects share common needs for data types and utility functions. This project aims to provide a shared library of TypeScript types and utilities for identity-related projects, promoting consistency and reducing duplication across the ecosystem.

# Alignment with the OpenWallet Foundation Mission

By providing a common set of types and utilities, this project helps ensure interoperability between different identity solutions. It supports the OpenWallet Foundation's mission to foster collaboration and standardization in the identity space, making it easier for developers to build compatible and robust identity applications.
