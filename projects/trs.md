# Project Description

Currently, there are many trust protocols such as "OpenID federation", "X.509 certificate", "EBSI Trust Chains" and so on. Due to the complexity of these protocols, it is not easy to implement a trust resolver system in client side. That's why Trust Registry Query Protocol(TRQP): https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-trust-registry-protocol is created.

In this project, we aim to implement a Typescript reference implementation of the TRQP. and extends it so that people can obtain trust information even without detailed knowledge of the standards. My goal is to build an infrastructure like the one described below.

# Alignment with the OpenWallet Foundation Mission

The Trust System is also a crucial component with the Issuer, Holder and Verifier. Trust System makes sure not only the credential is valid but also the issuers, wallet instances and relying parties are trusted.
