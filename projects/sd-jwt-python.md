# Project Name

SD-JWT Python Reference Implementation

# Project Description

This is the reference implementation of the [IETF SD-JWT specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/) maintained by the editors of the specification together with other contributors. It is written in Python.

So far, this implementation was maintained in the IETF SD-JWT draft repository and did not have an official status or license attached. The maintainers have taken initial steps to move this project to a separate repository with proper licensing.

# Alignment with the OpenWallet Foundation Mission

This library implements the Selective Disclosure for JWTs specification, which is an important building block for future digital identity wallets.
