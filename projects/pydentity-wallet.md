# Project Description
The PyDentity Wallet is a Progressive Web Application for providing [acapy](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy) access to mobile wallet features and browser API access.

The wallet provides a frontend for a multitenant acapy instance which can be bound to a local mobile device storage.

The app works with iOS and Android and allows users to easily manage an acapy subwallet.

Whenver possible, it uses existing open standards from W3C, IETF, DIF, and other open standards groups.

# Alignment with the OpenWallet Foundation Mission
This project aligns with the OWF mission, because it's an open source implementation of wallet-related open standards and enhances an existing OWF impact project.
